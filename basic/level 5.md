# Level 5
Sam has gotten wise to all the people who wrote their own forms to get the password. Rather than actually learn the password, he decided to make his email program a little more secure.

## 🎯 Objective
Extract the password from a server-side file that is **not PHP-executed**, meaning its code is visible in raw form.

# solution
- I used the same method and changed the mail. It worked. I don’t know the difference between this challenge and the previous one.
- Trying to make the email program more secure instead of fixing the actual problem on the site means the solution to Mission 4 also works in this mission. Follow the same steps to edit the email address value using Developer Tools and send yourself the password.
